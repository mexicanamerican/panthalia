Panthalia 👁️‍🗨️ 🎨 🖋️

Project Purpose
Panthalia (/panˈTHālēə/) combines the Greek roots pan- ("all"), thal ("bloom"), and -ia ("state of"). Together they roughly mean "a state of total flourishing".

The goal of this project is to enable quickly authoring and iterating on blog posts on the go from a phone. This results in pull requests on GitHub, which generate Vercel deployment previews to review on mobile. When back at a computer, posts can be polished up and published on a live blog.

The project will also explore and leverage AI services for automatic image generation based on prompts.

Together this enables a streamlined mobile-first blogging workflow resulting in high quality published posts.
